Original Problems:
- too strict about discriminator types
- too strict about how registration happens

Problems w/ Eric's solution:
- Compiler does not enforce discriminator names

TODO:
- example like CarFactory
- example like DtoTypeFactory
- test cases demonstrating usage of factory for instances
- test cases for multiple discriminators mapping to same type
